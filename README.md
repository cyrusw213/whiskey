# Name
The Spirit Within

## Description & Features
This app enables users to browse through the 99 most popular whiskeys ([per Wikiliq](https://wikiliq.org/best-whiskey/)). The user can sort by whiskey type or view them all in one master list. The user also has the ability to rate each whiskey type on a scale of 1-5. If the user wishes to go even further they have the ability to mark all of their favorite whiskeys which will then be added to a favorite page.
