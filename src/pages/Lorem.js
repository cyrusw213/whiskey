This is a test of the local GitHub Push/Pull Request System. The developers of your area in voluntary cooperation with the Git Master have developed this system to keep everybody informed in the event of a GitHub emergency. 
If this had been an actual emergency, (optional -- stations may mention the types of emergencies likely to occurr in their area) the Attention Signal you just heard would have been followed by official information, news or instructions. 
This station serves the GA area. This concludes this test of the GitHub Push/Pull System.
